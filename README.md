# Machine Learning Projects

These projects are performed as part of the [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). 
Each of the final projects include techniques and methods for different aspects of machine learning and correspond to one of the modules of the course. 
In each directory is a Jupyter notebook of all the work done for each project and the data being analyzed which was sourced from Kaggle. 
The links for each data set can be found in the written reports which are located in the `report` subdirectories of each project.
